# Taishi Uma
- Benevolent and adventurous noblewoman but ~~probably~~ reckless.
- Hails from [[Miromar]]: a city full of other aristocrats and the largest human kingdom.
- Accompanied by 3 retainers: [[Flume du Nobe]], [[Eschal]], and [[Logi]].
- Gifted with the "spark" seen rarely amongst the descendants of [[House Uma]].

## Appearance
A young human woman of average height and slender build. Her hair is often messy and short but is supernaturally blonde due to the "spark" of her family's human-aasimar heritage. She is often seen in armor but otherwise fancies comfy silk garments casually or equestrian-style clothing in more formal settings. Like other descendants of the Uma family, her eyes hold a slight yellow glow.

## Story
