# Myra
An ancient vampire queen who was freed by accident, thanks to [[The Shady Bunch]]. 
## Appearance
Said to have supernatural beauty
## Story
Originally, she was captured and being transported by a vampire-hunter in the mountains around the [[Isolated Imprisonment]] inside a large sealed jar on the hunter's back. Thinking that an innocent Fimorrian woman was being held captive, the hunter was killed by Patch and the jar was broken. A hideous and mocking laughter was heard as the black mist inside escaped and vanished into the air.

Myra shows up again in Act 2, having cultivated thralls out of the villagers of [[Belano]], with about half of the town infected with her blood. After a long and bloody fight, the party managed to defeat her after being cornered at he Crownsguard's garrison. After a critical strike from [[Leia]], Myra's misty form was absorbed in the [[Gyoop]] jar and kept till the morning sun, killing her for good.
