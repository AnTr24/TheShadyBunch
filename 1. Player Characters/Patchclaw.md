# Patchclaw
A seemingly detached thief who keeps to himself and tries to avoid danger.

He works for a [[The Edge of Vision|mysterious organization]].
## Appearance
Hold him up and he becomes  a long cat. Often unseen, cloak and daggers by his side.
## Story
- Patchclaw was one of the starting members of [[The Shady Bunch|The Shady Bunch]].

### Act 1
- He is looking for a client's stolen item.
	- It is revealed to be the cursed [[Times Postern]] staff that [[Toble]] has.
	- Patchclaw and Toble meet up with the client who agrees to have Toble keep the staff and discover more about it.
	- Receives a new mission from his guild
- Sometime in the mountains, attempts  to grab a [[Lighting Lotus]] for Gyoop but is struck and plummets to the ground.
	- Has a spiritual meeting in [[The Beastlands]] where he gains affinity with the Lynx spirit. 
	- Discovers others with [[Animal Spirits|animal spirits]] such as [[Tahba]] and [[Maahes]].

### Act 2
- Patchclaw meets up with a [[Alessi|contact]] from his guild while in [[Miromar]]
	- Patchclaw manages to procur some information on underground activities and a boat to travel to South Klisas, but it will take some time.
- After The Shady Bunch escapes [[The Eye]]'s lair, Patchclaw's lie is discovered several days later. 2 of its agents bag Patchclaw and dragged him back. He makes a deal to kill [[John's Dalmry]] and take his treasure horde in order to spare the life of his party.
- Patchclaw discovers that his contact is working as the guild's liaison with [[The Eye]].

## Notable Powers & Equipment
- **Playstyle - Scout and solo striker**: Often scouting ahead for danger. Tends to dive into the backline to assassinate dangerous targets.
- **Rogue - Thief**: Makes most use of his climbing speed and increased stealth.
- **Known Feats**: Mage-slayer.
>"What do you mean its a spell-like ability???" - Mr. Mage Slayer
- **Poof! the dagger:** A dagger infused with "returning-weapon" thanks to [[Shannon]].
- [[Nightstalker's Mask]]: A demon-faced mask. Using it, Patchclaw is able to turn invisible when whenever he uses Hide until the end of his next turn. It ends early when attacking a creature but deals extra psychic damage.
- Spirit of the Lynx: Part of the set of [[Animal Spirits]]. This allows Patchclaw to supernaturally leap at enemies farther and deadlier, and probably other things I forgot.

## Trivia
- "YAAA, Sneak Attack!" is his oft quoted attack phrase.
- Every cat meme you've seen applies to him
- Holds a grudge against magic casters (Don't tell him about the martial-caster disparity)
