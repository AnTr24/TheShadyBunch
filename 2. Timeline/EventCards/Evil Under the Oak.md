# Evil Under the Oak
- Using Toble's curse, the party makes their way towards the mark, sticking near the mountain ranges to avoid the [[Fields of Blood]].
- There is a close encounter with a scouting party of an orc warband, but they manage to stealth past the patrol.
- Eventually they reach the eastern shores of Bliurica, finding what appears to be an [[Old Guild Hall|old manor]] next to a large hill with an oak tree on top.
- Climbing the hill, they spy on the house below. The party does not notice any activity but spots some windows on the 2nd floor and decide to sneak their way in.
- Stealthing towards the house, the party uses ropes to ascend to the upper floors.

## Living Quarters
>[!cards]

- The party land on the 2nd floor, viewing a hallway with several doors, seemingly an old living quarters. They use some empty bedrooms as cover to ambush cult guards roaming the halls.
- The the guards taken care of, they investigate the rooms:
	- One room they find several magic items stashed away such as the [[Aegis Terrum]] and [[Paper Cranes]]. A cursed staff is also found, resonating strongly with [[Toble]]. [[Patchclaw]] also recognizes it as the item his client is searching for. Toble picks up the the staff, transforming briefly into her adult form.
	- Another room seems to be have been repurposed into a holding cell for [[The Cult]]'s victims. Adjacent to that room appears to be quite damaged. Gyoop recognizes the acid burns along the walls and chains. He can feel that one of his brothers, [[Troop]], was locked away here.


## Main Hall
>[!cards]

- They then encounter  [[Sarin]] and [[Burgell]] surprisingly waiting for them in the main hall. They have stayed behind expecting [[The Shady Bunch]] to pursue them and are here to prevent further meddling.
- Two spells rain down on the party. At some point Patchclaw and Gyoop and polymorphed into turtles.
>Lettuce. Waater~
- Burgell is cornered but manages to teleport away.
- On his own, Sarin takes out and imbibes a mysterious black potion. It transforms him into an abomination, twisting his flesh and growing to Huge size. 
- The party is able to put down the monster, as the twisted flesh burns away, an evil/cursed ring is all that remains of Sarin. The party elects to throw it off into the coast.

## Dining Hall
- Searching the rest of the manor, none of the missing people are found, it seems they have been relocated. There are signs that a boat had docked along the nearby shore, but it is unknown how long ago.
- The party gathers together to check the last room: the dining hall.
- Opening the doors, they see a large dinner table and several portraits. Looking at the dusty portraits, this building seems to have belonged to an old adventuring party.
	- **Grandfather's letter**: Wiping off one of the large portraits, [[Taishi]] discovers her grandfather's image. Hidden behind the plaque is a box holding a letter left to her. Reading it, the letter explains how he grew frustrated with the courts blocking reforms to the [[Miromar|the city]] and the people's living conditions. It goes on to outline  his journey since he left home. Taishi unlocks her radiance die after reading the letter.
- At the back, the party discovers a [[Scrying Mirror]]. Activating it, the [[Mirror Matron]] speaks:
>"'This is **Mudmurk**, do you have something to report?"

Seemingly expecting Sarin or Burgell. The party notes a blueish glow and an underground cave behind her. They make a deal for information and proof of [[Bruce]]'s life. In return, one of the party must use the [[Serpent Whip]] lying on a nearby table as well as them promising to  destroy the mirror on their side. A [[Magical Agreement]] made, Taishi volunteers herself and strikes her arm with the whip. She notices that part of her magic/vitality is absorbed and sent somewhere. Satisfied, the Matron has cultists drag Bruce nearby and his screams are heard as he is tortured. The Matron then ends the connection.
- The party goes outside, using one of the [[Paper Cranes]] to search for Bruce. They see it fly away from the shore, likely to another continent.
- They plan to discuss their findings with [[Eulysses]].
- At first, they attempt to take the mirror with them, but ominous warning signs eventually convince them to destroy it as they toss the shards out on the road.
