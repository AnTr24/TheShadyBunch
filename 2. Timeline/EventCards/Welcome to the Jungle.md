# Welcome to the Jungle
[![[GyoopScience.png |cover banner+small]]](GyoopScience.png)
- Jasper's scout lead the group down the mountains before parting with the group.
- Before reaching the ground-level, the party spots far off what seems to be a shadow-covered land amongst a desert.
- However, at the base of the rocky cliffs is a wide jungle nestled in the shadow of the mountains.
- As he turns to leave, the scout notes that the group's destination will lie past the jungle and somewhere to the North-East.

## Wild Creatures
- As they traverse further into the tree-line, they encounter a pack of what seem to be apes that can shake their tails to produce a blinding light.
	- The party defeats the ape after shaking off the blinding effect, [[Shannon]] harvests some of the tails to  make "flashbangs".
- Further in, they find a small village hidden within a clearing amongst the trees. Despite the dangers of the jungle, it looks very undefended.
- Before they can converse with the locals, several large cats/panthers were spotted stalking the party.
- However, some magical effect seems to be preventing predators from entering the village, and they leave without incident.

## Village of the Golden One
- The locals warmly greet the outsiders. Some can be spotted praying at a large golden statue of a dragon at the village's center. As well, a chieftain's hut is seen atop one of the trees in the village.
	- Statue Message reads: Of the Golden Light. May You See and Fear His Sight, Or Bow to his Truest Might
- They learn that this village is called [[Midwood]], which is under the protection of [[Vorodin|"The Golden One"]]. They hold a festival anually in his worhsip, with the next happeneing in a few weeks. The village is also led by their chief, [[Alexi]].
	- The party meets with Alexi, who welcomes them. After the party mentions their destination, the chief offers to have a hunter accompany them to the edge of the jungle, and invites them to return for the festival.
- The party rests up in the village for a day, mingling with the locals
	-  [[Gyoop]] visits the herbalist, [[Jaren]], who teaches him about the local plant life.
	- Gyoop demonstrates his skills to [[Shannon]], showing how  he is a "scientist" too! Gyoop plans to make many potions from here on.
- Next day, the party sets out with the hunter.
- Before reaching the edge of the jungle, they take a small detour, finding what seems to be a huge banana tree. The super-sized "bananas" are called [[Candonas]], and are naturally sweet.
- A great deal of effort is spent by the group to climb the tallest branches to get the sweetest fruits.
- Rose note but not sure: I believe this is also when [[Patchclaw]] climbed the tree to get Thunder Buddy and experienced his first death.
- As they reach the edge of the jungle towards the [[Fields of Blood]], the hunter warns the group that the fields are filled with several warring tribes of orcs and are best avoided.
- The party gifts some of the candonas with the hunter to take back to his village and they say their farewells.
