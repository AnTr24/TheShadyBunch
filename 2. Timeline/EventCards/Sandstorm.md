# Sandstorm
- Trying to shake off any further pursuers from [[The Cult]], [[The Shady Bunch]] flee the city of [[Faal'Krel]], making their way across the desert with [[Taishi]]'s carriage.
- They get about halfway across the desert when harsh winds and cloudy skies begin to pick up around them.
	- Looking around, they spot a huge tornado in the distance. They are unable to make out its bearing, and so press on hoping for the best.
	- Hours pass and for awhile, the storm seems to be moving somewhat parallel to them when it suddenly begins to veer around.
	- In only a few moments, the tornado rapidly begins to approach their location.
	- Amongst some rocky lowlands, the party spots a ravine and decide to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass.
	- As they bolt everything down, a small cave entrance is seen ahead.

## Into Deep Rock

- A few of them get curious and decide to explore the caves, perhaps in search of a better shelter.
- The path reaches a fork and they decide to split their search party.
- Team A: [[Maahes]], [[Ophelia]], [[Gyoop]] and others(?):
	- Travel for awhile until faint skittering is heard. 
	- Something is moving through the tunnels ahead of them. 
	- Ophelia gets scared at the noises, hearing  more sounds around them.
- Team B: [[Taishi]] and [[Shannon]] and others(?):
	- They stumble across a side room and see countless chains hanging from the ceiling.
	- [[Taishi]]'s divine sense detects an undead presence all around them, as if the chains themselves are moving around them.
	- An ominous figure is seen seated in the distance, but it is too dark to make out and doesn't appear to be moving.
	- [[Taishi]] makes the call to leave the room, and they make it out without incident.
- Team A:
	- Exploring further, they come face to face with a small nest of eggs with ant-like creatures about the size of a man crawling around with sounds of many more heard in the distance.
	- They manage to stealth their way out of the caves without incident.

## Bedbugs
- The party reconvenes outside and discusses what to do. The caves are too small for the wagons but they are worried about the bugs/giant ants inside. They decide on setting up makeshift traps and alarms near the entrance.
- Outside again, the retainers finishing bolting the wagon as they brace the storm's strong wind. Luckily nothing too dire as the nearby rockwalls shelters them but they'll need to lay low for a bit.
- Later that evening, the party decide on watches as they turn in.
	- During [[Gyoop]]'s watch, a lone bug skitters over to the cave entrance, taking the bait.
	- He leaps from his post and squashes the bug, killing it. 
	- Unbeknownst to Gyoop, it was able to spray pheromones as it died, with Gyoop's form readily absorbing the scent....
	- Gyoop continues his watch before changing shifts and returns to camp.
	- Next watch: a loud rumbling is heard from the deep tunnels and the alarm is sound.
- Everyone prepares to meet the horde of bugs rapidly approaching camp and initiative is rolled
- Swarms of giant ants quickly flow all over the party, not caring about and opportunity attacks.
- Several sink their mandibles into Gyoop, poisoning and dragging him deeper into the cave.
	- Despite the party's efforts, the ants dragging Gyoop manage to survive the retaliation and disappear into darkness.
	- The party makes a mad dash towards Gyoop and [[Maahes]] manages to thin the horde enough to make it to his body. Everyone else arrives to tend to Gyoop before a larger horde is heard approaching them, estimating about 10x the one they just fought.
- The party makes their way back outside as [[Taishi]] casts a sleet storm to slow the horde's approach. 
- Undeterred by the cold magic, the ants charge the cave entrance as [[The Shady Bunch]] makes  a stand. They must delay the ants long enough for the retainers to unbolt the wagon! 
	- [[Maahes]] leaps directly into the horde, ferociousness fighting with the spirit of The Beast and grabbing much of the horde's attention as the rest of the party supports.
- The retainers signal that preparations are complete as they and the mounts are swarmed.
	- One grabs onto Flume but she manages to strike it down. Logi and Eschal fire their crossbows from the wagon as the party makes their retreat. As the party enters the wagon, one makes to bite at Taishi's donkey, [[Noble Steed]] but a rear kick knocks off their pursuers as the group kicks into motion.
- The head into the desert, assailed but covered by the strong winds and dust storm. After an hour of travel, Gyoop no longer detects any followers with his blind sense.
