# The Frost Giants
- [[Shannon]] finishes her preparations with the local smiths, preparing a package using  much of the gunpowder supplies the garrison has left.
- [[Taishi]] has the soldiers prepare themselves for battle, they agree to setup an ambush in the forest closer to the bridge, setting up equipment on top of some ridges
- The party sets out across the standing bridge, finding the frost giant's cave above a tall ridge facing the bridge. Before making their climb, [[Shannon]] sets the bomb under the bridge's support.
## The Clan's Cave
- The party stealthily makes their way into the cave, clearing out side rooms with a couple giants. After reaching a central meeting room, they spot the frost giant king sitting on his throne, surrounded by the bulk of his kin.
- The group hatches a plan, having [[Gyoop]] morph his body into a dragon's head while illusion magic is used to sound the roar of a real dragon.
- Taishi hurls a firebolt towards the king as the illusion of the dragon rounds the corner.
- The party succeeds their rolls to taunt the giants, prompting the entire clan to chase them out the caves.
## A Feast For the Worms
- They make a hasty retreat out the entrance of the cave before realizing the ridge they faced would take too long to climb down normally, aside from [[Patchclaw]] who can easily make the descent.
- Like the waterfall, they elect to jump off the ridge, Gyoop going first so that he can use his stretchy form alongside slow fall to catch the others.
- The group runs across the bridge, hurling projectiles to the giants behind them.
- Enraged, clan leaps off the ridge, chasing them across the bridge with the king leading the charge.
- Confirming the last of the horde has entered the bridge, [[Shannon]] sets off the fuse as the last of the Shady Bunch makes it across.
- They watch as the bridge buckles and collapses from the other side. Much of the frost giant clan falls into the chasm below with the exception of the king himself who barely manages leap across to the group.
- A battle ensues, but thanks to an enlarged Shannon, he is pushed off the ledge.
- The party looks over the ledge. Within the darkness, familiar rumblings are felt while they catch glimpses of the [[Giant Purple Worm|giant purple worm]].
