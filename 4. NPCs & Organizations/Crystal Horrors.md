- Countless hordes of crystal creatures psionically controlled by a legendary eye monster encased within a crystal tower.
	- The source of the eye's psionics is deeply related to [[Leia]]'s family.
- They were sealed in the [[Subterranean Crystal Caves]] until the Shady Bunch [[Behind the Barn|curiously knocked down a wall in the basement of a barn.]]
- The controlled monsters are creatures ranging from medium to gargantuan size consisting entirely of their signature blue crystal. Many appear to be bipedal with spiked crystalline arms.
	- A single strike from the monsters are enough to cause [[Crystallization]].
	- Seem to have a severe aversion to fire
- They were neutralized after the tower and eye was destroyed.
