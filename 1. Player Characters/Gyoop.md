# `=this.Name`
Gyoop.

## Appearance
Gyoop.

Gyoop is an amber-colored sentient ooze. He favors a muscular humanoid build but like most of his kind, is able to reform his body into any shape. 
Alongside his back and arms are hex-patterned greenstone protrusions from "Rock Buddy". 

## Story
- Gyoop.
- Gyoop was one of the starting members of [[The Shady Bunch|The Shady Bunch.]]
- His earliest memories were waking up and being adopted by his [[Augustus|master]] alongside his brothers.
- They lived in a forest a ways off from [[Riverpont]] where his master taught them the ways of life and martial training.

### Ooze-kind
- [[The Diviner]]:  [[Eulysses]]'s conducts research on Gyoop:
	- Discovers some affinity for the air like an elemental
	- Likely to originate from another plane, [[The Wastelands]] rather than the material.
	- Unlocks Gyoop's **Ooze Pacifism**: 

### Missing family
- His master [[Augustus]], and his brothers suddenly disappeared after an attack by the cult during their hunting hour.
	- We find a couple of his brothers, Loop and Soop, at the hands of [[The Cult]], but is still missing his brother Troop and his master.
	- Gyoop finds his master's [[Augustus|journal]] in a hidden alcove at their [[Gyoop's Home|home]].
	- It likely they have been transported to [[Southern Klisas]].
- While in Klisas, discovers there are others of his kind, one in particular named [[Bubbles]]
	- Bubbles tells Gyoop that in his lost memories, he was actually a being known as the "Prince Supreme," who led all of his peoples towards an era of peace. 
	- In [[The Wastelands]], there existed 4 tribes of ooze-kind that were led by their respective Princes. The tribes have constantly been in conflict with each other until the arrival of the "Prince Supreme."
	- It is likely his brothers were also rival Princes from this time.
	- Gyoop eventually frees Bubbles from slavery at the hands of [[Abe Beppu]]
