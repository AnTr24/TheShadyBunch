## History
Rraynia has gone through 7 distinct eras:
-In the first, the gods walked the world and shaped in as they saw fit 
-In the second, the elements forced their way in and Dragons ruled the world. 
-In the third, the was moral conflict between the mortals created in the gods image against the powers that tried to keep their hold. 
-In the fourth, mortals banded together and claimed the world from those that created it 
-In the fifth, the Blood Wars broke out as conflicting interests sprang from both the Gods, and their champions 
-In the sixth, the wars came to an end and the peoples were given their own lands to rule as their own. 
-The 7th era is the current era. Known as the era of "Peace"
