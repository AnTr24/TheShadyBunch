# `=this.Name`
- Benevolent and adventurous noblewoman but ~~probably~~ reckless.
- Hails from [[Miromar]]: a city full of other aristocrats and the largest human kingdom.
- Accompanied by 3 retainers: [[Flume]], [[Eschal]], and [[Logi]].
- Gifted with the "spark" seen rarely amongst the descendants of [[House Uma]].

## Appearance
A young human woman of average height and slender build. Her hair is often messy and short but is supernaturally blonde due to the "spark" of her family's human-aasimar heritage. She is often seen in armor but otherwise fancies comfy silk garments casually or equestrian-style clothing in more formal settings. Like other descendants of the Uma family, her eyes hold a slight yellow glow.

## Story
- Taishi was one of the starting members of [[The Shady Bunch|The Shady Bunch]].
- Awakens her unique powers at the [[Old Guild Hall]] after finding her [[The Late Lord Uma|grandfather]]'s letter.
- Convinced [[Thorin]] to step away from the [[Stoneheart]].
- Held a speech to rally the people of [[Fimore]] during the raid of the [[Crystal Horrors]].
- Bolstered the courage of the [[Belano]] villagers
- Rejected the advances of [[Rinn Yuio]]
- Recruited the [[Amnesiac Haundavar]] to her house and set up a partnership with [[House Inian]].

### Act 1
- Wore Fimorrian-styled chain mail and sword&shield for combat.
- After her bloodline's powers strengthens, her body has the appearance of always slightly glowing.
### Act 2
- Returned to Klyssian-styled equipment: Inherited her grandfather's plate armor/family heirloom and a glaive as her weapon of choice.

## Notable Powers & Equipment
- **Playstyle**: **Allrounder**: Variety of ways to do control, damage, and healing but no specialty. Main caster of party.
- **Paladin2**: No oath taken. (I believe in smite supremacy)
- **Sorcerer - Divine Soul**: Gives her access to cleric spells and extra dice in form of Favored by the Gods and enhanced healing ability. (Upcasted Bless, my beloved)
- **Magic Armor**: Full adamantine plate armor as of Act 2
- Several arrays of magic items
- **Known Feats**: Prodigy(Persuasion Expertise), Inspiring Leader

### Touch of Divinity
- Has a pool of d8s that recharge on a long rest called 'Radiance Die'.
- Radiance Die may be used to increase Taishi's damage or healing by the number rolled.

## Trivia
- Inspired by Toyosatomimi no Miko from the Touhou Project, Miko is also nicknamed Crown Prince or  "Taishi-sama".
- Fond of the arts and tales of heroics
- When she was younger, often skipped out on her studies to practice swordplay with her grandfather or wander around town
- Her aasimar heritage is about ~1%
