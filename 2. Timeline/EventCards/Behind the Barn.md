# Behind the Barn
- The party are enjoying their downtime but [[Leia]] has a nightmare in her sleep about [[Fimore]]'s countryside.
- They head out to take Leia for a walk to ease her mind.
- Passing several acres of farmland, they reach a particular barn with an apple tree outside.  The farmer comes out of his house, sharing with the party some apples while asking if they would be willing to check on some mysterious noises he's been hearing from his basement.
- [[Shannon]] leads the way down behind the farmer, and inspects the dwelling, finding nothing out of the ordinary until a small crack seems to be forming behind one of the walls.
- A group decision is made, and with the farmer's consent, the wall is broken down.
- It gives way to a cavern tunnel right behind the rubble. 
- Immediately, a wave of living crystal mass, now alerted by the sound and draft of air, surges forth from the tunnel towards the party.
- The party runs as fast as they can, trying to escape to endless wave as innumerable [[Crystal Horrors]] pour out the gap. Unfortunately, the farmer and his family did not make it out the house in time.
- They make it into pass the city gates right as the guards slam them shut. Looking back, they manage to catch a glimpse of the farmlands being consumed by the blue mass as they destroy everything in their path and crash upon the city.
- The Shady Bunch prepare themselves to aid in the city's defense
