# Searching Gyoop's Home
- The party decides to look around Gyoop's home for further clues
- A place further into the forests near the mountains where his "[[Augustus|master]]" adopted and raised Gyoop and his brothers.
- Gyoop dives into the nearby river sensing a hidden opening he's never noticed before
- Found the [[Augustus|Journal of Augustas]], left by his master. It details his adventures and several locations he visited in the past. Most importantly, there is a message that says the reader may "find me using this".
