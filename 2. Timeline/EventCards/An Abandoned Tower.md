# An Abandoned Tower
- The party is searching deeper into Riverpont's woods when they stumble upon a seemingly abandoned tower. As they approach, they spot a camp of gnolls right around it.
- Sneaking their way into the tower, the party find a study room with an intact magic circle.
- The circle begins to activate, signifying someone teleporting into the room.
- The party waits, and encounters a [[Sarin]] with a black misty hand and obsidian necklace.
- The man escapes by teleporting again and undoing his magic circle.
- The party searches the rest of the study, finding clues that the man they saw was likely a cultist and "they" are paying for his services. It is confirmed that [[Augustus]] was the most recent kidnapping alongside and intelligent man from [[Fimore]] about 2 months ago.
- There is a map that leads to somewhere far east, and north of the [[Fields of Blood]]. Likely where captives are being transported.
- They find a small chest with some gold.
- The gnolls outside have are on alert thanks to the commotion with the mage.
	- The party holds out at the top the tower and the front door, picking the camp from a distance while defending the entryway.
	- Notable [[Leia]] begins throwing chairs at the gnolls from the rooftops, critting one.
- They return to Riverpont to inform the mayor that the gnoll threat is dealt with and collect their reward
- Overall, the party decides to visit the city of Fimore to:
	- Research the sigil sequence of the magic circle
	- Stock up on supplies before travelling east
