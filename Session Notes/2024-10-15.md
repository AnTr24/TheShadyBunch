"Robot" secretary named Headwig

Visited Gadian to get roots and Dream-lily for a potion
Father of the current Valentin, asked the Headmaster for such power
Plane of Fire, he spent over a decade hunting down one of the greatest dragons
Succeeded > Dissected > grabbed the heart
But...he wanted more: Took the bones too, bringing it back and had an expert/friend file them down
A painful procedure, to embedded the bones of that dragon to him
The aspect of that dragon yearns to be set free...igniting his soul

Eye of Cyclops
Arm of Hag
Bones of a White Dragon

Downside of augments unknown until then
Taishi rejects the augment

Figure in audience
Burly thick figure, golden robes, black hair, lighter toned black man

Champion:
Twice as tall as taishi
Much more burly; rippling muscles
Beastly face, snout, fur, horned
2 hooves
longsword covered by a towershield
battleaxe and chain
= An enormous minotaur

Before the battle:
As if time has stopped for everyone else, an angel appears above the two contestants, looking at Taishi. 
My kin, and our legacy. The time has come. All of the heavens watch upon you. You, the embodiment of the heart us Uma possess. The heart of our guardian angel and the legacy of our bloodline. A heart that has already earned the pure faith of three other hearts. Your destiny calls to you, though destiny is decided by your actions. Will you carve out your own destiny this day?
The angel then fades away into the minotaur's body

Taishi wins initiative,
attacking with a Summon Dragon
The minotaur cleaves it in 1 hit
Taishi plays defensively, using Gyoop's flight potion, blink rom Voyager staff and keeps distance
Lots of spells and sorcery points from Taishi are used to avoid getting hit and keeping tempo
The minotaur shrugs off Taishi's ranged assault, defends himself with the tower shield and try's to chain in Taishi when possible
Minotaur finally lands a crit and with legendary actions, action surges to drive damage in.
Most of the hits break through Taishi's reactive shield spell but the armor keeps her safe from the crit.
