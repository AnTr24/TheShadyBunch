## Trivia
- Basic training to become a Steelworks member tends to be the wall that keeps hopefuls from being members. It is infamously grueling and have had multiple horror stories across [[Dragonspire]].
- The company has a Steel Defender mascot that stays in the main HQ building. His name is Fibonacci and is Bruce's first construct. 
- Heated disputes among members can and will happen. These tend to be settled through a physical bout between the two parties known as "Kur'van Vir" or "Honor Dispute". These are often brutal and quick but always ends up with the disputers holding no grudges and some even end up being close friends at the end.
