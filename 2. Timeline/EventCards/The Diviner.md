# The Diviner
- The party walks up to the wizard's tower, and are greeted by his familiar.
- Introducing themselves, [[Eulysses]] takes a keen interest into [[Gyoop]] as an unusual creature and is willing to exchange information for permission to conduct research onto Gyoop.
- Gyoop agrees to the mage's request and the two conduct research over the next few days, leaving some downtime for the party.
- Gyoop and Ulysses discover that Gyoop is not originally from this plane, and that he somehow lost his memories when he awoke on this world. As well, it is likely that Gyoop is not merely just an ooze, as there are traces of Elemental wind in his body.
-  In return for the research and from becoming friends with Gyoop, Ulysses makes a few discoveries for the party:
	- The magic sequence is pointing towards Eastern [[Bliurica]] , somewhere around the mark on the map they found. Ulysses uses divination to view a [[Old Guild Hall| decrepit building]] by a hill. 
	- Toble's curse appears to resonate with the divination and is tugging her towards the location.
	- They will have to cross over the a treacherous mountain path to reach their destination. As such, he gifts them clothes that will magically keep them warm.
