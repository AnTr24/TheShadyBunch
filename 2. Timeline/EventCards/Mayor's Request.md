# Mayor's Request
[![[gnoll.png|cover banner+small p+tc]]](gnoll.png)
- The mayor of [[Riverpont]] greets the adventurers in town 
	- He reveals gnolls normally don't stray this close to town and have recently infested the surrounding area for some reason
	- As well, some adventurers have also passed through Riverpont but have also gone missing
- The mayor requests the party to look into the recent gnoll activity
- The mayor also  pleads for aid in rescuing his daughter who has fallen into the river and floated downstream
- As the disappearances seemed related to most of their issues, the adventurers decide to band together to share information and fulfill the mayor's request, thus [[The Shady Bunch|The Shady Bunch]] was formed
- Unbeknownst to them, this would only be one of many in a [[The Cult|long string of disappearances]]

## Missing People
- Shannon's father, Brandon
- Gyoop's brothers and master
