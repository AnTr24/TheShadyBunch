# `=this.Name`
One of [[Taishi]]'s retainers since she was young. A serious and stern maid, Eschal has tried countless times in the past to moderate [[Taishi]]'s behaviour to little avail. 

Her attitude has softened quite a bit after adventuring with the party.
## Appearance
Eschal is normally seen in the traditional maid attire of the Uma family, with her red hair tied back into a bun under her maid headdress. After losing her left arm, it has been replaced by a brass dwarven prosthetic.
While she also carries a crossbow for self-defense, she seldom uses it after awakening to her magic.
## Story
- During the raid at [[Fimore]] by the [[Crystal Horrors]], she lost her left arm to [[Crystallization]], forced to have it  cut off by [[Maahes]] in order to save her life.
- Taishi was able to get her a dwarven prosthetic made by the [[The King's 1st Miners]].
- Eschal awakened to her sorcery during the boat trip back to Klisas, gaining the initial ability to cast frost magic.
- While Flume and Logi were left to rest at the [[Uma Manor]], Taishi took Eschal with the party to the [[Bluestone Mines]]
	- During the [[Underdark]] arc, she scored several NAT20s against Illithids and supported the party's efforts with Silvery barbs.
## Notable Powers & Equipment
**Blooming Sorcery**: Awakening to her magical abilities
## Trivia
- Nicknamed "QUEEN" by several players due to her hype rolls
