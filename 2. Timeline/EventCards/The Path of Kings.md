## Before the Gate
A trek up the mountains and going past the [[Isolated Imprisonment]], they spot a large stone structure above them. There is a statue of a dragon connected to the mountain wall. They spot an opening through the dragon's nose, and using various methods, ascended the statue to follow along until into the mountain proper. It becomes apparent that connected is a longer series of stairs and passageways that go up and around the mountain side.

## The First Trial: Not As It Seems. Find what to gleam 
![[trialofkings1_tablet.jpg|hsmall]] ![[trialofkings_tablet2.jpg| hsmall]]
- After a long travel, the tunnel opens up into a clearing on the mountainside. On a wall, they find a large crest filled with several tablets but there appears to be an empty slot.
- [[Shannon]] goes to search a well in the center of the room: Seeing something stuck deep to the side above endless dark. Securing herself with [[Patchclaw]]'s endless rope, the party holds on as she goes in to hoist up the tablet. The tablet is much heavier than expected, and despite the party's combined effort, their grip on the rope nearly breaks as the party is edged closer and closer towards the well. Barely able to inch backwards, Shannon is hoisted over the well, tablet in arms. As they place it into the slot...nothing appears to happen.
- The party spots a bush(?): Nothing inside.
- Another tablet is eventually spotted below the ridges of their clearing, wedged several feet below into a separate vertical face of the mountain: [[Taishi]] secures herself with a climber's kit and rappels down to the tablet. The tablet is hanging a bit off from their ridge, and as she kicks off her surface towards the other and grabs the tablet, their combined weight causes the climber's kit to give. The rest of the party hurriedly grabs onto the rope secured by the pitons. Taishi nearly falls off the mountains with the tablet, but just barely with combined efforts of the party manages to lift her back up. This time, the tablet wedges into the empty slot and one of the walls of the mountainside gives way into an inner chamber.

## The Second Trial: Put you through through the test
>[!aside]
>During the short rest, Hayden sends some lyrics based on "The Brady Bunch" in the Discord: 
>``` 
>Here's the story, of a lovely lady, 
>Who went adventuring with three retainers, free 
>and a tabaxi that's a rogue, plus a young girl 
>Who claims she's more mature 
>
>Here's the story, of a sci-en-tist 
>Who was busy with experiments out abroad 
>She found a slime man, and a little half-elf, 
>with chees exorbitant 
>
>'Til the one day when the ladies met together, 
>And they knew it was much more than a hunch 
>That this group would somehow form a party, 
>That's the way we all became the Shady Bunch!
>```
>The official name of [[The Shady Bunch]] is formed.

- A spiral stair case is seen at the end of a hallway.
- It takes several to about an hour to arduously climb the narrow vertical stairwell
- At the top, the party is exhausted and decided on a short rest to recover.
	-  [[Maahes]] swears during the climb and  [[Gyoop]] and [[Leia]] happen to hear it, to the dismay of [[Ophelia]] and [[Shannon]].
- Moving on, they eventually came across a chamber/ pit dotted with several platforms.
![[trialofkings2_Path.png]]
	- Each platform is of roughly of same height but has differing sizes and gaps. The gaps seemingly ranger 10-30ft between platforms.
- Scouting out the closest platforms, the endless rope is used to tie the party together for safety.
- The party is initially successful, but midway through, 3 members get pulled off the platform.
- A recover is managed and they slowly make their way to the other side.

## The Final Trial: Passing are only the good the best
- In the final chamber, two statues are found. One of a bull and one of a lion.
- Initially dormant, they activated once the group made their way and a door sealed the entrance.
- The bull charged, and [[Maahes]] went to meet it. He was able to break the statue but it quickly reformed and attacked once again.
- Remembering the riddle, [[Taishi]] placed herself in the path of the statues. They looked over her for a moment before returning to their podiums and going dormant again. The exit of the chamber reveals itself to move vertical stairs.
