# `=this.Name`
One of [[Taishi]]'s retainers since she was young. A casual and straight-forward man, Logi grumbles when hard work is pushed onto him but is quite loyal in actuality.
## Appearance
Logi wears practical and simple clothes as necessary for a working hand on the road. He has brown hair and eyes. While he maintains cleanliness, he makes little effort to appear "presentable," having somewhat dishevelled hair and clothes. Defends himself with a crossbow.
## Story
- Nearly lost his leg when giants attacked the carriage outside of [[Miromar]].
	- Thankfully Runliel was able to tend to his wounds, but he was forced to recover at the [[Uma Manor]] for a few months.
	- During this time, [[Taishi]] gifted him a dog to keep him company.
## Notable Powers & Equipment
## Trivia
- Most likely to help Taishi avoid her studies.
