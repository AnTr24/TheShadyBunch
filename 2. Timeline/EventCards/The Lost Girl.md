# The Lost Girl
- Following the river, we reach a waterfall at the edge of the deeper forest
- Like all good PC parties, we elected to jump right off the waterfall instead of taking the detour.
- Allowing the river to drift them further in the forest, they follow the girl's path.
- After some time, the rivers appears to be funnelling towards a [[Gnoll Cave|cave mouth]].
- [[Mary]] is seen a distance away unconscious at the bank of the river but some gnolls are already fishing her body from the waters.
-  A fight ensues as the party stops the gnolls from dragging the girl further into the cave.
- Defeating the fiends and some archers that reinforced atop a ledge, the party rescues the girl and decides to search the cave further.
- Deeper into the cave, they find dead gnolls and an eery ritual room.
