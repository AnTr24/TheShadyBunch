# Golden Wings
- Reaching the top of the mountain, they spot a large cavemouth. The party cautiously make their way towards it, unsure of what they might find.
- Inside they see a robed man, sitting by the cave wall.
- The stranger faces them and calmly explains that he is [[Vorodin]] the Golden and the guardian of [[Midwood]].
- He explains that while he was away from his lair, [[Ydanyn]] set up an ambush at his home, setting up a  trap that would seal him.
- Vorodin walks over to the entrance of the cave and demonstrates himself being unable to leave the lair through any means. However, it seems that the seal only works on dragons and thus the party isn't affected.
- The party agrees to help the trapped dragon and he offers magic items to aid them, such as a [[dragon-slayer dagger]] and [[belt of giant strength]].
- With his powers, he opens a portal that will lead them somewhere near [[Ydanyn's Cave]].

- Stepping through the portal, the stone ground peels away into sandy dunes in all directions. 
- Searching around, they find a a strange opening in the side of a large dune.
- A couple of members are sent in to scout as they find Ydanyn asleep.
- The scouts return and the whole party gathers up and prepares to ambush the dragon.
- With most members entering the inner chamber, they find that the  sleeping dragon is nowhere to be found.
- However, they look back and clinging on the wall above the entranceway, a shimmer of topaz is all they see before a wave of cold death washes half the group. 
	- Aside from a large amount of damage, several members are hit by some sort of charm alongside the exhaustion effect.
	- The ones in the chamber rush to swarm the dragon with those outside noticing the commotion and coming to reinforce. 
	- Ydanyn attempts to fly out of the melee but has his movements hampered.
	- [[Taishi]] casts 'Command' on the dragon twice, with the last cast taking hold.
	- Unable to resist, the dragon is forced to grovel and falls to the uninhibited attacks of the party.
- With the dragon slain, the party is free to loot its horde
	- Leia claims the dragon's heart after strangely expertly slicing her way to the core
	- The rest attempt to loot the horde for gold and magic items
- However, they don't have long as the "cave" rumbles and sands begin to fall upon then.
	- With Ydanyn dead, the magic holding up the sands has dissipated, and the cave alongside the treasure horde is rapidly being buried in collapsing sand.
	- The party stop their looting after grabbing a few items and make their way towards the exit, barely making it out
- As they collect themselves, they find themselves transported back into [[Vorodin's Cave]]; Infront of them is the full majesty of a gold dragon.
	- Vorodin thanks the party for freeing him from Ydanyn's trap
	- Taking time to answer their questions, he also reveals that he is responsible for setting up the trials they passed through. Originally, it was part of his pact with the [[Kingdom of Fimore]]'s first king as a means to test the worthiness of their successors. Eventually he settled down in the mountains and took care of a nearby [[Midwood|village]].
	- He takes the party back to the village to finish the annual festival
