## Session Summary 
%% After-session 1-paragraph recap%%
A slam is heard at the [[Uma Manor]], which turned out to be the fragment of [[Gyoop]] that [[Eulysses]] was studying. Apparently, his researched has unlocked some of Gyoop's latent affinity for the primordial, even being able to open up a portal anywhere within minutes. After the party returns from Eulysses' tower via the same portal, they each decide what to do during their downtime. Several members spar in the backyard to overcome to somber mood following [[Nightingale]] and [[Runliel]]'s deaths; during which [[Doros]] joins in and formally introduces himself. Afterwards, the first week of downtime begins. [[Leia]] does research onto her background, [[Taishi]] prepares for a duel with [[House Yuio]], and [[Shannon]] focuses on her missing arm. 3 days in, [[Alessi]] knocks, telling [[Patchclaw]] the boat he requested is ready at [[Clover Island]]. An hour later, several [[Crownsguard]] led by a slender man in white armor  knock on the door, looking for: Taishi, Shannon and associates...
