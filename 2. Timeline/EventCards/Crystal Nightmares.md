# Crystal Nightmares
## Desperate Defense
- It isn't long before the gates crumble under the assault of the [[Crystal Horrors]]. The party sees two guards being pierced by the creatures, immediately undergoing [[Crystallization]].
- Doing everything they can to not get pierced, the party and guards do their best to hold the line while civilians are evacuated into the inner walls.
	- From the corpses of some guardsmen, the party notices that the monsters seem to be avoiding the dropped torches. They relay this to the guardsmen, and some rush off through the city to spread the word.
- As the defensive line is pushed back, [[Gyoop]] notices a lone boy trapped in one of the houses and crystal figures closing in on him. Gyoop rushes to the boy's aid, managing to rescue him in time.
- The party manages to fight to the gates of the inner walls. Several towers along the perimeter light up, as magic sigils become active from the king's mages. Round after round of fireballs and other powerful magics are unleashed, buying time for the civilians and party to be ushered inside.
- [[Taishi]] scans the survivors, but the retainers are nowhere in sight.
## A Spark of Hope
- The party notices that unrest is quickly brewing as an argument breaks out between some civilians and guards; a mob is quickly forming within the inner walls.
- From a podium, a guard captain is shouting at the civilians to settle in but it only agitates the crowd.
- [[Taishi]] walks up to the podium and delivers a speech to the civilians, urging them to trust and work with the guards to save their loved ones. As well, she reveals that the the [[Crystal Horrors]] are afraid of fire, and encourage everyone uses their torches and to spread the word. The mob is pacified while soldiers appear to coordinate with the mages for a push into the city to rescue the remaining civilians trapped outside. The captain sends an order to grab whatever torches they have from the armory.
- [[Eulysses]] finds the party in the courtyard and notes how an endless stream of those creatures seem to be pouring out from the farmlands. The party describes what they saw at the barnhouse and the group hatches a plan to use the sewer system to make their way back to it to investigate.
- [[Eulysses]] leads them to a porthole in the inner courtyard which can take them near one of the side gates of the outer walls.
	- Surfacing, they open up to a neighbourhood nearby the gate but see [[Crystal Horrors]] patrolling several areas. They stealth amongst the ruins as they spot huge and gargantuan-sized crystals looming over some houses searching for signs of life. 
	- They make it past the walls and sneak under the cover of the farmland crops as the last of the crystal wave shambles into the city.
	- Reaching the barn, they see the crystallized corpses of the farmer and his family as they make their way deep into the basement's tunnel.

## Counterattack
- It takes them about an hour or 2 of traversal, as an eery silence permeates the long hall, slowly leading them deeper underground.
- Eventually the tunnel opens up to the very top of a large cavern containing several ledges and sub-tunnels spiralling down towards the bottom (~200+ ft deep).
- At the center is an impossibly large crystal tower with an eye encased in the crystals pulsating with intense energy.
- The party deduces that this may be the brain/control tower of the creatures.
- Rather than fighting through the lair's sub tunnels, the party comes up with a plan to leap the chasm:
	- Taishi and Toble will stay at the top and provide fire support from the high ground
	- Gyoop will float Leia and Shannon towards the tower by forming into a parachute
	- Patchclaw will descend using his climbing speed
- The party executes their plan, with Gyoop and co. leaping from the ledge as they float towards the tower.
- The eye gazes up on them but the mages follow up with a volley of firebolts and eldritch blasts
- The tower shakes in response, as  blasts of psionic energy fly out from the crystal structure.
- Gyoop and co. land and begin attacking towards the core.
- Taishi scores a critical. Empowering her next firebolt with all her radiance die, a bright mote of fire hurls itself towards the tower, carving a huge hole into the structure and exposing the core.
- For the first time, a legendary action is deployed as the tower emits a huge pulse of psychic energy, downing Taishi and severely wounding many of of the group.
- The core is damaged, many of those on the tower are knocked towards the ground but manage to descend safely.
- Suddenly, two oddly-humanoid crystal beings are summoned, attacking Leia and Patchclaw, who are on the ground level.
- Meanwhile, Toble and those remaining on the tower attempt to finish off the core.
- Another pulse of energy is about to surge when the killing blows is dealt to the eye.
- The tower begins to crumble and the crystal-humanoids immediately stop and collapse on the floor dead.
	- As Leia walks away from the rubble, a voice calls out to her from the collapsed beings: "Leia....is that you?..."
	- Cautiously making her way to the bodies, from within her mind the voices reach out to her. Memories of her parents and her people flood into her mind. A vision forms of how this creature turned their people into its mind-slaves and siphoned the tribe's psionic powers for its own. At the end, her people have been trapped for many years as it used their psionic energies to produce horror after horror. After the vision fades, the visage of Leia's parents stand before her before fading away.
	- As she cries, a power begins to dwell within her, finally knowing the truth of her people's legacy.
- Meanwhile the rest of the party rushes to the top, tending to Taishi's wounds. Afterwards, everyone reconvenes as they get ready to make the trip back into the city.

> [!kith|c-black] **Iz/Leia** _If I get a dream and I see crystal blue like the goddamn crystal tower LOL_

> [!kith|c-black] **Iz/Leia** _I'm not going near any barn_

- Taishi goes to look for her retainers..finding [[Eschal]] clutching a missing arm and flanked by two strangers.
> [!kith|c-yellow] **Ivan/Gyoop** _HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMS IN GYOOP_
- They introduce themselves as [[Ophelia]] and [[Maahes]], explaining that her arm was being [[Crystallization|crystallzied]] when they found her, and that they had no choice but to cut it off.
- [[Gyoop]] comes by and upon seeing the retainers, gives everyone a group-hug; including the strangers.
- Ophelia was suprised but overjoyed at Gyoop's cuteness and dragged Maahes into joining [[The Shady Bunch]].
