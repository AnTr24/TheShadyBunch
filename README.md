# Using the Wiki
## Publishing Changes
- Master files are hosted on GitHub as a repository
- You have the cloned local files on your desktop that you can make changes to or sync with the master ones.
- Branches: If you make changes or a change is mad eby someone else, Github will notice the differences and ask you to "commit" them. By default to the main branch. You may make new branches to test bigger changes or test things on.
-  Syncing: Check Github Desktop to see if there are any chagnes you need to import from the repository/branches.
-  Commit: This will save your local changes. Make a title for the commit and include a desciption of what you changed.
-  Publish: You make many commits before publising them. Once you are done, publish your changes via the app.

## In Obsidian
Obisdian is the note taking software we will use to edit the wiki. The wiki formatting itself is powered by a plug-in called ITS themes. Should be pre-configured by default once you downlaod the vault.

- ITS Themes: https://publish.obsidian.md/slrvb-docs/ITS+Theme/ITS+Theme

Other:
- The "Templates" folder holds...templates that you can rapidly add markdown to. if my hotkeys are sycned too, Use "Alt+T" to insert a template into any note.
- Add images and other references to the "z_Attachments" folder
- Anything in the folder "0. Personal/" will not by synced by design. Use this to store your own stuff
- Remember to publish your commits and check for syncs!
