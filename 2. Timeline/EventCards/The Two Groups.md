# The Two Groups
- [[Taishi]] and her retinue start their road trip towards [[Riverpont]]. It isn't long until she hears yelling further in the forest running into [[Patchclaw]] and [[Toble]] being chased by gnolls.
- Meanwhile [[Gyoop]], [[Shannon]], & [[Leia]] are having their own encounters with gnolls in a separate location in the forests.
- The separate parties fight off their pursuers before individually making their way to [[Riverpont]]
- Meeting up, they grab bread from the local bakery and discuss their reasons for travelling:
	- Taishi: Seeking adventure
	- Gyoop: Looking for his missing brothers and master
	- Shannon: Her father has gone missing
	- Patchclaw: On a job to search for an item
	- Leia: Also on a job, she delivers "cheese" to a [[Jonathan|citizen]] of Riverpont apparently worth 420g.
	- Toble: Finding the man that cursed her
