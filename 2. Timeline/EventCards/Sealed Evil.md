# Sealed Evil
- The party hears the screams of a woman somewhere up the path
- The party comes across a warrior carrying a sealed jar on his back but no lady in sight.
- [[Patchclaw]] catches her scent coming from the jar on his back
- The man refuses to answer his questions, continuing down the mountain
- After a confrontation, Patchy kills the man and unseals the jar.
- A [[Myra|black smoke and hideous laughter]] rings towards the sky...
- Realizing their mistake, they grab the man's body, hoping to find a cleric within the castle.
