# Maneaters
- [[Toble]] has a dream about a large monster devouring everything in its path.
- The party comes across a broken bridge with frost giants picking up and eating soldiers whole. A sickening crunch and the last soldier's scream is heard as the party rushes in.
- They defeat the giants and leap across the broken bridge, travelling on foot while the retainers decide to take the carriage back to [[Riverpont]], awaiting [[Taishi]]'s word once the mountain pass is clear.
- Later that night... the party is camping on a clearing on the mountainside when [[Leia]] and [[Toble]] see far off in the distance the visage of a giant worm shaking the further mountains.
