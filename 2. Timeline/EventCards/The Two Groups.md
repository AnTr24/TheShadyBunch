	- The three go to hold off the gnolls and hyenas from reaching the wagon. Ina  show of bravery, Patchclaw leaps into the fray first bit is downed by the pursuers.
	- With the the retainers support-fire off crossbow bolts the back of the carriage, Toble and Taishi manage to finish off the group.
	- Taishi grabs ahold of Patchclaw, healing with a lay-on-hands, earning admiration.
- Meanwhile [[Gyoop]], [[Shannon]], & [[Leia]] are having their own encounters with gnolls in a separate location in the forests.
	- Leia was on her way to [[Riverpont]] to deliver cheese and found Gyoop. She accidentally stepped on him while Shannon witnessed this whole thing.
	- Shannon took the two children to make a campfire for the night, talking amongst each other and introducing themselves.
	- They heard monsters coming to their direction, which they learned to be gnolls and wolves. Proceed to fight them.
