# The Green City
![[Faal'Krel.jpg|banner+tall]]
[[Faal'Krel.jpg| Full Map]]

- With more time on their hands, [[The Shady Bunch]] decide to visit the shaded lands in the desert they saw earlier. Under what appeared to be a black disc over the desert, was a land of perpetual darkness.
- Travelling through the desert, they eventually reached the shaded region near the south coasts. In the distance, they make out the dim outline of a city.
- Entering through the gates, they spot a vast array of stalls and houses along the main road. There seems to be a wide variety of races living in this city, but notably a notable presence of under dwellers like the Drow. It seems even the citizens here don't even think twice of [[Gyoop]]'s prescence.
- They make it partway into the city until being noticed by the watch party of Drow agents posted on the rooftops. The party is followed for awhile before being being stopped and questioned.
- The agents don't appear hostile but insist on taking the party to the rulers for further questioning as  Fimorrians have never been in the city before.
- The party is escorted to the palace, where the city's Matrons(?) await to interrogate the nnewcomers.

- The rulers explain that this city, [[Faal'Krel]], is the home of the [[Kreen Dynasty]], who have kept themselves distant but non-hostile to the [[Kingdom of Fimore]]. 
	- They agree to let the party roam the city freely as a gesture of good will. 
	- If the party is interested, they also request that next time they return to [[Fimore]], if they would look into rumours of [[Dunamancy]] being practiced by practitioners the [[Azure Academy]], promising a reward if they do.
	- The meeting then concludes as the agents escort the party out of the palace before departing.



## Dragonchess After-Hours
- A bit of exploration and shopping is done but evening arrives as the party decide to rest at an inn.
- [[Maahes]] decides he wants to have some fun tonight and leaves the inn in search of a bar. He manages to find a place and is ushered down to a basement.
- Entering a sort of seedy establishment, Maahes is offered some drinks and a hit of an *exotic substance*. 
- Not having enough, Maahes makes a sudden demand for icecream before also asking for one of the establishment's ladies. A handler introduces one to him in a mask and provocative dress and they are led to a private room.
- Maahes is barely able to maintain a sense of reality but makes it down the hall and into the room.
- The masked lady closes the behind them, and as he turns towards her, she approaches and eyes him up and down.
- Maahes returns her gaze before stumbling over his words to say: "So...you into dragonchess?"
	- Shortly after, he is stabbed with a poisoned dagger.
- As Maahes falls unconscious, the lady pulls down her cover to reveal a [[Rinn|missing left eye]], with black mist flowing from socket.

## Deadly Eyes
![[Faal'Krel_Inn.jpg|banner+tall]]
- Later that night...
- Everyone makes themselves comfortable in their rooms as they prepare to spend their first night in Faal'krel. 
- Gyoop and Shannon settle in when a knock is heard at their door.
	- Gyoop goes to answer but notices someone unfamiliar with his blindsense.
	- The door is forced open as a [[Rinn|female assassin]] charges him.
- Hearing the commotion, the rest of the party manages to wake up and and goes to investigate.
- As they open their doors, they see a [[Burly Assassin]] guarding the halls, making out his missing right-eye.

> [!kith|friend c-black] **Sam/Ophelia** _He made his problem everyone else's problem_

> [!kith|friend c-orange] **Hayden/Patchclaw** _HIS PROBLEM IS LOOKING FOR US_

- Initiative!
	- During the fight, [[Rinn]] is seen imbibing a [[Mage's Best Friend|black potion]], seemingly letting her concentrate on two spells at once.
	- Despite this, the party manages to kill both assassins, surviving the night.
	- On Rinn's body, they find [[Rinn's notes|her notes]], with a possible list of assassination targets.
- The party notices [[Maahes]] isn't with them, and checks his room.
- He is laid out in the bed severely wounded and unconscious. He is healed and then questioned as to what happened. Maahes says he was just out for a night of dragonchess that evening but ended up getting stabbed.
- Everyone is surprised [[The Cult]] was waiting for them here and decide to leave the city ASAP.
- Maahes ended up interrogating the Burly assassin and sliced him in half. 
- Cutting their visit to [[Faal'Krel]] short, the party quickly gathers their belongings and hop on the carraige, riding out from the city and into the surrounding desert.
