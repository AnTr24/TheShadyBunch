## Story
- [[Mayor's Request]]: A string of disappearances have occurred throughout the lands. People have been vanishing seemingly into thin air / without a trace, including Gyoop and Shannon's family.
- [[Abandoned Tower]]: An [[Sarin|hooded figure]] of is encountered. A black mist flowing from where a hand should be. They seem to be transporting local victims to a hideout in eastern Bliurica.
- [[Evil Under the Oak]]: The party finds the [[Old Guild Hall|building]] where captives were stored. Expecting Sarin or Burgell, a [[Mirror Matron|mysterious figure]] within the [[Scrying Mirror]] slips out the name **"Murdmurk"**. A deal is made and [[Taishi]] uses the [[Serpent Whip]] on herself, siphoning some of her vitality/magic for a ritual. The party learns their real base is underground in some bluish caves in a  different continent. 
- [[Return to the City]]: The party learns that the cult is amassing vast magical energy for their ritual. Whether kidnapping people, using the [[Serpent Whip]], or stealing magic items like [[Times Postern]].
- [[The Green City]]: Rinn is sent to assassinate the Shady Bunch as they rest within an inn. She too has black mist where a hand should be.
- [[Revelations]]: [[Master Orethon]] agrees to research into [[Murdmurk]] if they do a favor for [[House Inian]].
- [[Noble Houses]]: After the party reports to [[Lord Inian]], Taishi meets up with Orethon who describes his research into the cult.
- To be continued...
