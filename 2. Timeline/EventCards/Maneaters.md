# Maneaters
- As they approach the mountains, it becomes clear that the carriage will be ill-suited for the travel. The party decides to travel on foot while the retainers take the carriage back to [[Riverpont]], awaiting [[Taishi]]'s word once the mountain pass is clear.
- The party comes across a broken bridge with frost giants picking up and eating soldiers whole. A sickening crunch and the last soldier's scream is heard as the party rushes in.

- They defeat the giants and leap across the broken bridge
- Later that night... the party is camping on a clearing on the mountainside when [[Leia]] and [[Toble]] see far off in the distance the visage of a [[Giant Purple Worm|giant worm]] shaking the further mountains.
