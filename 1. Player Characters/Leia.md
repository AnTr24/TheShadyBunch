- During a delivery of 420g cheese for a [[Johnathan Rimpid]] of [[Riverpont]], Leia met a deflated [[Gyoop]] at a riverside and an observing [[Shannon]].
- Later in [[Riverpont]], she met [[Taishi]] and her retainers, [[Patchclaw]], and [[Toble]] at one of the inns. 
	- *Their journey starts there...*

### Ipsissimus

- It is revealed that her people have been psionically enslaved and they are the masters of the [[Crystal Horrors]].
	- Through her travels before the incident of the [[Crystal Nightmares]], she collected a t-rex stuffed animal in [[Fimore]] and a bear stuffed animal in [[Riverpont]] in hopes to one day find her real family to give to them. After saying her final farewells to her parents, Leia placed the stuffed animals where she last saw them and mourned for her loss.
	- Learned that her family is from West [[Aeslea]].
- Notably Leia would receive dreams through out their journey that tends to be premonitions of what's to come.
	- Dream one: Between the events of [[An Abandoned Tower]] and heading back to [[Fimore]], Leia had a dream she heard whispers of people that was luring her towards them. Then the appearance of an eye showed up the moment she got closer. She started falling into darkness through silhouettes of people. She woke up with a nosebleed.
	- Dream two: Leia dreamt she was bandaging the same wounded soldier at the [[Isolated Imprisonment]] like earlier. [[Adrian]] was walking away from them while the hand she was grasping grabbed her hand and pulled her *into* him. She closed her eyes at this sudden act, opening them to find herself in the familiar darkness of her first dream. Voices started ringing out, calling for her, "Find us....You're the last...Please!"
	- Dream three: The dream that led to the events of [[Behind the Barn]] and [[Crystal Nightmares]]. Leia found herself outside of a farmhouse in [[Fimore]]'s countryside. As if she was flying, she went inside to a hallway that lead to the kitchen. There is a basement just downstairs, and she sees a wall that has a stone tunnel and blue behind it. There are muffled voices behind it calling out to her. "Free us...Daughter, we love you..Trapped Below. Below Fimore!" Constant whispers barraged her, giving her the distinct feeling that her family is there. She screamed before feeling herself being pulled away. Leia woke up with a bunny head mark at the back of her right hand.
	- Dream four: Leia had a dream she saw different versions of herself. Nothing to notable except it was a trippy and still wonders why.
	- Dream five: Had a dream about seeing and hearing static. Currently have no idea what that's about. 
- Due to her psychic abilities, Leia receives visions from someone's mind and an object.
	- When she touched [[Maahes]] one day, she saw a vision of him as a bloodied man.
	- During the [[The Boat Arc]]...
		- Used her Telekinesis to Moses the waves apart on a night the boat and its crew was struggling to keep it safe
		- Attempted to reach out to [[Toble]] and someone told her, "This is her choice. She needs me, not much you'll do now. I am her one." She also saw her paralysis demon.
	- During the [[Trouble In The Mines II]]...
		- Leia used Detect Thoughts on a weird guy who was guiding her inside a cave and she saw the layout of the 100 mine cart rails that is like a web. 
		- Simultaneously, she saw a memory from [[Amnesiac Haundavar]] of his wife and kids. Then an ilithid ambush on his group. He was at the same spot where they met him. There was a deceased Haundavar on a chest plate.
		- Continuing to help the [[Amnesiac Haundavar]] with his memories, Leia saw the birth of his kids. The name of his wife starts with a V.
- During [[Miromar]], [[Taishi]] was given a **Scorched Journal of Mudmurk**. Curious about it, Leia took hold of it and she saw the incident of Shademurk. There was a boy with a brown buzz cut and a girl with wavy hair. The both of them was wearing ragged clothes. Abnormal multicolored flames threatened a town before a wave of mud washed over it. Leia felt the fire as if it was burning her too. After the vision, she tried to draw out the boy and girl on a piece of paper but it ended up being a blank page to the others.
