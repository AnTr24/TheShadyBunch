# The Topaz Terror
- Much of the city proper lies in ruins, but cleaning and reconstruction efforts have already gone underway.
	- The dockyard managed to survive but it'll still take a few weeks before the ship is ready to embark.
	- As the party decides what to do, [[Flume]] suggests they visit [[Midwood]] for the festival.
- Thanks to the party's efforts so far, the road up to the mountains are now well-maintained by the kingdom and they reach the village without incident.
- Arriving, several villagers greet the party and the smell of food permeates the air as the festivities are about to begin.
- A large shadow passes over the sky above, and a strong gust of wind brushes the village as something large descends.
- What landed was not gold, but a dragon clad in topaz scales.
- It lets out a large roar and the villagers cower.  Introducing itself as [[Ydanyn]], it commands the obedience of the villagers, saying that it has dispose of their guardian.
- As the party debates whether they can fight it, it senses their intentions and lets out its breath weapon. The party is hit with a wave of cold that causes exhaustion, bringing many of them to ~half health. The dragon warns them not to interfere before flying off.
- They decide to interfere, and manage to calm down some of the villagers to ask them about the topaz dragon. Apparently it is a rival of their golden lord and while he is usually much stronger than Ydanyn, it seems something has changed. If they want to investigate, the party will have to travel high up the mountains to the guardian's home.
