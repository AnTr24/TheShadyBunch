# Behind the Barn
- The party are enjoying their downtime but [[Leia]] has a nightmare in her sleep about [[Fimore]]'s countryside.
- They head out to take Leia for a walk to ease her mind but she finds herself tugged further into the farmland until they reach a particular barn with an apple tree outside.  The farmer comes out of his house with [[Shannon]] going to speak to him. Sharing some apples with the party, the man asks if they would be willing to check on some mysterious noises he's been hearing from his basement.
- [[Shannon]] leads the way down behind the farmer, and inspects the dwelling, finding nothing out of the ordinary until a small crack seems to be forming behind one of the walls.
- A group decision is made, and with the farmer's consent, the wall is broken down by having Gyoop form into a wrecking ball.
- It gives way to a cavern tunnel right behind the rubble revealing hidden stone hallway blocked by blueish crystals.
- Leia again feels a tug, coming from further into the tunnels and the group decide to bash down the blockage.
- Immediately, a wave of living crystal mass surges forth from the tunnel towards the party.
- The party runs as fast as they can, trying to escape the endless wave, as innumerable [[Crystal Horrors]] pour out the gap. Unfortunately, the farmer and his family did not make it out the house in time.
- They make it into the city gates right as the guards seal the entrance. Looking back, they manage to catch a glimpse of the farmlands being consumed by the blue masses as they destroy everything in their path and crash upon the city.
- The Shady Bunch prepare themselves to aid in the city's defense
