# Belano
A town that has recently attracted rumours around the faith of "The Lord", whom is granting a cure to any ailment, including the [[Stirge disease]] and even lost limbs.

## Story
- After [[Maahes]] and [[Ophelia]] were stricken by [[Stirge disease]], the party takes the two to Belano upon hearing rumours about a cure.
- They discover the Church of the Lord is offering a cure and are greeted by the [[Myra|Head Priestess]] and [[Pastor Lyrin]].
- As the party exposes [[Myra]]'s trickery, she turns the blood within the already infected villagers, transforming them into thralls and starting the [[Belano Night Raid]].
## Geography
Surrounding the town is vast wilderness connected through a small but maintained road to the rest of [[Northern Klisas]]. The town itself is medium-sized, which room for a large church, smithy, stores, and a major [[Crownsguard]] garrison.
##  Notable Locations
- **Crownsguard garrison:** Able to accommodate  hundreds of soldiers, the garrison is more like a small fort.
- **General Store:** Run by two children named Alli and Bobby after their parents died in the night raid.
- **Church of the Lord**: Base of operations for [[Myra]] and her thralls. A large diamond was discovered in the basement by [[Shannon]].
- Local Smithy
