- The group collects themselves and return to the ambush site
- Some of the soldiers are a little disappointed they didn't get to take revenge themselves but [[Didus|the largest of the men]] [[Taishi]] trained with, comes out and cheers, lifting the spirits of the soldiers.
- Everyone reconvenes at the fortress and a celebration occurs.
- [[General Jasper]] congratulates the party, rewarding their efforts with food and gold.
- Jasper notes how he can finally return to his family after tending to the defense for months, alongside many of the surviving soldiers at this outpost. Word will be sent soon to Fimore, and supplies are expected to arrive shortly. Jasper agrees to send a messenger to Taishi's retainers now that the danger has passed. As well, he offers to lend one of his scouts to show them the way out the mountains once the carriage arrives.
