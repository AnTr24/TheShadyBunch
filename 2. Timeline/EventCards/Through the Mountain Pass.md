# Through the Mountain Pass
- Travelling towards the path, they make a stop back at Riverpont to check up on the mayor and some info about the area.
- Along the way, what seems to be an oddly fast storm is approaching their carriage.
	- Its a stampede of flying fish!
	- [[Flume du Nobe|Flume]] races the carriage through as the storm engulfs them. Meanwhile, the rest of the party is desperately fighting off the fish crashing into them.
- The party eventually makes it into [[Riverpont]], where the mayor greets them and gives them some advice. They can take a northern path to avoid the mountains but it is mostly frigid wastes and a long detour. Otherwise the mountain path will be about a 10-day trek but there are talks about how one of the king's castles have come under attack from frost giants. As well, there have been sightings of harpies and purple lizard-like(?) creatures in the area. Additionally, the mountains hold several dangerous ravines that they should avoid.
