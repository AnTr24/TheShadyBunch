# Return to the City
- The Shady Bunch make their way back to [[Fimore]], backtracking their way to the city.
- A short stop is taken at the [[Isolated Imprisonment]]. Most of the soldiers from before are already replaced with fresh troops, including [[Didus]] and [[General Jasper]].  
	- A messenger lets the party know that the [[Ulric Valentin|King of Fimore]] has invited them to his court to reward them for lifting the previous siege.
	- [[Taishi]] goes hunting in the mountains, slaying a snake that can petrify its prey and gifts their tails to [[Shannon]].

## Back at Fimore
- King's court: 
	- The party are greeted into the king's courtroom.
	- He thanks the party for lifting the siege of [[Isolated Imprisonment]], granting them a [[Token of the King]] as well as gold and other treasures.
	- After the meeting, [[Taishi]] sees [[Didus]] training with the soldiers of the keep. He has recently been promoted to "The Red Knight." [[Taishi]] and [[Flume]] spend some downtime to train with him.
- [[Patchclaw]] takes  [[Toble]] to his client's residence to discuss the [[Times Postern]]
	- The client leads them to a vault in his basement, revealing that he is an artifact collector/preserver of sorts.
	- He's kept tabs on how items like it have gone missing from his own collection and many others across the city; likely due to the cult.
	- Allows Toble to keep the staff, saying it would help her learn about her curse and that it is safer in her hands anyways.
- [[Leia]] and [[Shannon]] go to meet [[Shephard]]. [[Shannon]] spots something off about the cheese shop but doesn't press further.
- The party meets with [[Gyoop]] at [[Eulysses]] tower to discuss their findings about on [[The Cult]]
	- [[Serpent Whip]]: Created by the cult to siphon magic for some dark ritual.
	- "Mudmurk" ""and the blue caves: Cross-referencing with the flight of the paper crane and research records at the [[Kobolt Soul]], the mage deduces that Mudmurk refers to a 100+ year old village somewhere in [[Southern Klisas]].
- Docks:  The party reconvenes at the dockyard, ready to a charter a boat to [[Klisas]].
	- A merchant ship agrees to drop them off at [[Northern Klisas]], even making space for the carriage. However, they won't be leaving for at least a 3 weeks and so the party has some downtime.
